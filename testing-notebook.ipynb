But they have a much greater impact on deforestation by consuming cleared land, savanna, and transitional forests, thereby pushing ranchers and slash-and-burn farmers ever deeper into the forest frontier. Soybean farming also provides a key economic and political impetus for new highways and infrastructure projects, which accelerate deforestation by other actors.\" ¶ Satellite data from 2004 shows a marked increase in deforestation along the BR-163 road, a highway the government has been paving in an effort to help soy farmers from Mato Grosso get their crops to export markets.

       "    'content': 'U.S. sanctions are premised on the belief that strangling Cuba’s economy will lead the system to fail, motivating the Cuban people to rise up against their government and establish a multiparty liberal democracy. After five decades, it has failed to achieve its goal. Instead, it is inhumane and counter-productive. In addition to inflicting pain on the people we are ostensibly trying to help, the sanctions could even prompt a mass exodus out of Cuba, putting the stability of the Caribbean at risk. Twenty years ago, amidst the wreckage of the Special Period, U.S. Congress and the Executive Branch tightened sanctions with the hope of capitalizing on Cuba’s difficulties. American policy missed the chance to align itself with the humanitarian interests of Cubans and their leadership muddled through. As U.S. sanctions became more restrictive, we ceded the playing field to allies and competitors—Spain and Brazil, China and Venezuela—who are still in Cuba today, investing and trying to help its economy grow. While the fate of Cuba’s economic reforms rests primarily with the government and the Cuban people, actions taken by President Obama, however limited, are now playing an important supporting role. But the United States can do more. We have a new opportunity to be seen by Cuba’s people and its future leaders supporting their efforts to build a new economy and to help the Cuban people lead more prosperous lives. The greatest contribution our country can make now is to demonstrate we want the reforms to succeed, because we want the Cuban people to succeed. If this were a core principle of our democratic policy, a series of logical steps could then follow. First, President Obama and other U.S. policy makers should acknowledge that Cuba’s reforms are real; that this program opens the way to a greater role for the market, and the changes are likely to exact great hardships on the Cuban people. They should also acknowledge that the reforms represent an important beginning. Until that all happens, our ambivalence plays into the hands of hardliners in Cuba who oppose reform or rapprochement with the United States. Second, Cubans lack cash and credit to make full use of their newly granted right to form businesses. The embargo and its byzantine sanctions prevent U.S. banks and developers from financing investments in Cuba. By loosening restrictions on travel and remittances, President Obama mobilized the financial capital and support of a good portion of the Cuban American community on behalf of Cuba’s economic revival. There are additional executive decisions the president can take to ease the flow of financing to Cuba and to spur demand for the activities the emerging private sector is performing. For example, the president could further loosen restrictions on U.S. citizens to travel to Cuba. Although repeal of the statutory bar against tourist travel to the island would require an Act of Congress, unlikely in this political climate, President Obama could use his executive authority to open and expand categories of opportunities for Americans to visit Cuba.128 As Stephen Propst, an expert on international trade and investment laws explained, “Although ‘tourist travel’ remains prohibited by statute, the President still has room under the current legal framework to significantly expand opportunities for legal travel to Cuba. For example, the existing category of travel for ‘professional meetings’ could be broadened to include a range of new authorizations for participation in meetings. … If combined with additional authorizations for the exchange of services with small private businesses in Cuba, the President could authorize travel for purposes of professional meetings with Cuban architects, artists, musicians, consultants and others.”129 According to this analysis, President Obama can, for example, order general licenses provided to freelance journalists, professional researchers, athletes who want to attend international sports competitions in Cuba, persons engaged in humanitarian activities, private foundations doing research, and business-related travel for authorized activities such as telecommunications, informational materials, and some marketing. He could also broaden the licensing for advisors from firms who could assist the Cubans in safe drilling and environmental protection as Cuba explores for oil in the Gulf of Mexico (as CDA recommended in the 21st Century Report on energy). There is a broad consensus extending from the U.S. travel industry to the international human rights community that travel to Cuba should be expanded: travel is a constitutional right of U.S. citizens and has the added virtue of providing U.S. businesses broad opportunities. For Cuba’s citizens, it provides a source of profits and jobs for small businesses. We also encourage the Executive Branch to clarify remittance expansion rules established in January 2011. President Obama has said any American is permitted to send remittances to an unlimited number of qualified Cubans of up to $2,000 per year each, but guidelines for sending remittances to non-family members are vague and need to be better defined. The regulation has no mechanism to open the door to Americans without family ties who wish to contribute remittances to Cubans they do not know and, if they could, no means for accountability exists for U.S. citizens to see if their donations were making a difference. Neither does the rule say whether the U.S. government allows Cuban recipients to seek or aggregate remittances from U.S. citizens. And answers are also needed from the Cuban government—it could identify recipient institutions which could distribute remittances to Cubans in need. A report released this year by the Cuba Study Group (CSG) suggests a number of additional steps that would allow Cuban goods to legally enter the U.S. market and advance the humanitarian goals of our policy. The CSG proposed allowing U.S. individuals and institutions to contract with Cuban scholars, musicians, and artists for their work and allowing independent farms and cooperatives to export agriculture products from Cuba (Obama granted a similar exception to sanctions on North Korea in 2010 for importation of North Korean beer.130) Their paper also called for a $50 million fund for rotating micro-loans and other measures.131'}],\n",

       "    'content': 'Small businesses and self-employment are considered an invaluable component of economic growth and job creation in countries around the world. This holds true not only in traditionally market-driven economies, but also in Communist countries with economies long dominated by the state. In 1978—the first year of the Chinese “open-door policies” credited with fueling its unprecedented economic growth—there were only 140,000 businesses operated by self-employed entrepreneurs in China. By 2005, that number had surged to 24.6 million enterprises, employing 49 million Chinese. In fact, since the late 1980s, the average annual growth in the number of small businesses operating in China has exceeded 30 percent. With this growth, the contribution of private enterprise to China’s GDP has also increased. In 2000, China’s National Bureau of Statistics reported that the private sector accounted for about 42.8 percent of the national GDP. By 2005, that proportion had grown to nearly 65 percent. According to the most recent estimates, private enterprises (including companies in which the government holds a minority stake) contribute about 70 percent to China’s GDP. But, Cuba is not China. And the vast numbers of variables that drive growth in any economy make cross-country comparisons difficult. There are, however, some universally-accepted truths about small and microenterprise development: onerous bureaucratic hurdles to business formation or formalization, burdensome taxation, lack of capital and excessive government meddling in price determination all deter and hurt entrepreneurs. To overcome these problems, countries in transition like China, Vietnam or Singapore—and countries in crisis, like Bolivia in the 1980s—have taken important legal and regulatory steps to foster the creation and success of small and microenterprises. No single path of reform may be appropriate for Cuba. But there is ample precedent regarding both the timing and types of reforms needed to spur small and microenterprise creation and on the role that multilateral organizations, international aid organizations and international NGOs can play.'}],\n",

       "    'content': 'Through a complex series of federal statutes, Congress has codified the comprehensive U.S. economic sanctions against Cuba and restricted the President’s authority to suspend or terminate those sanctions until a “transition government” is in power in Cuba. Notwithstanding these statutory requirements, the President maintains broad authority and discretion to significantly ease specific provisions of the Cuba sanctions regime in support of particular U.S. foreign policy objectives recognized by Congress, including the provision of humanitarian support for the Cuban people and the promotion of democratic reforms. In fact, since Congress codified of the Cuba sanctions in 1996, Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama have each exercised this authority to ease the scope of restrictions applicable to Cuba, without action or approval by Congress. This executive authority to modify the Cuba sanctions is grounded in Constitutional, statutory and regulatory provisions that empower the President and the responsible executive branch agencies to grant exceptions to the sanctions through executive actions, regulations and licenses. The authority is particularly broad in certain areas, such as telecommunications-related transactions and humanitarian donations, where Congress has explicitly granted discretion to the President under existing statutes. Consistent with the relevant statutory authorities and restrictions, as well as statutory statements of U.S. policy objectives, the President arguably has sufficient legal authority to make the following types of additional changes to the current U.S. sanctions against Cuba: • Establishing “general licenses” for existing categories of travel to Cuba that are currently authorized only by specific licenses; • Expanding existing categories of authorized travel to include new travel provisions (along the same lines as the new authorization announced on January 14, 2011 for travel related to non-academic clinics and workshops in Cuba); • Revising existing general and specific license provisions to ease or eliminate current limitations and conditions applicable to travel and remittances to Cuba; • Establishing a new general license for the provision of services to Cuba (along the same lines as the March 2010 revision that authorized services to facilitate Internet communications); • Establishing a general license for entry into U.S. ports of vessels engaged in trade with Cuba; • Permitting payment for authorized transactions with Cuba (except sales of agricultural commodities or products) to be financed through letters of credit or other financing arrangements issued, confirmed or advised by U.S. financial institutions (but subject to statutory restrictions on the extension of credit for transactions involving “confiscated property”); • Authorizing imports of certain goods and services from Cuba; Modifying current export control regulations to establish more favorable licensing policies for additional categories of items that may be exported under specific licenses; • Establishing additional license exceptions for exports of U.S.-origin goods to Cuba; and • Expanding the availability of existing license exceptions to cover additional categories of exports and easing conditions and limitations on the use of those exceptions.'}],\n",

Legalizing and regulating marijuana will bring the nation's largest cash crop under the rule of law, creating jobs and economic opportunities in the formal economy instead of the illicit market. Scarce law enforcement resources that could be better used to protect public safety would be preserved while reducing corrections and court costs. State and local governments would acquire significant new sources of tax revenue from regulating marijuana sales. The criminalization of marijuana use disproportionately harms young people and people of color, sponsors massive levels of violence and corruption, and fails to curb youth access. The Drug Policy Alliance advocates marijuana legalization through a well-regulated market for marijuana production and distribution. We seek to enact change on the state and federal level through ongoing legislative efforts and through high-profile ballot initiatives in upcoming election cycles. DPA helped lead the historic campaign in 2010 to support Proposition 19 in California.

       "    'content': 'Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos is likely to open the Sixth Summit of the Americas in Cartagena next month with a standard welcome for Barack Obama and the 33 other leaders of the Western Hemisphere, but maybe there\\'s a more fitting greeting for the U.S. president: \"This is an intervention.\" After decades of partnering with the U.S. to pursue an aggressive, often controversial \\'war on drugs,\\' a number of Latin American leaders say they\\'re ready to discuss major shifts in regional anti-drug policy. Some of them have begun talk of \"decriminalization\" -- and they want to do it at the Summit, where the United States will have no choice but to talk up the merits of the prohibition policies it has long favored. The former presidents of Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico generated headlines in 2009 by jointly declaring that \"the war on drugs has failed\" and calling for decriminalization of marijuana, but the commentary was dismissed in some quarters as an easy argument to make for men no longer politically accountable as heads of state. Since then, however, several sitting Latin American leaders (on both the left and right) have called for candid debate of current drug policy. Among them: Mexico\\'s Felipe Calderon, Costa Rica\\'s Laura Chinchilla, Argentina\\'s Cristina Kirchner, Guatemala\\'s Otto Perez Molina, and Colombia\\'s Santos -- who told Britain\\'s The Observer last year that \"A new approach should try and take away the violent profit that comes with drug trafficking... If that means legalizing, and the world thinks that\\'s the solution, I will welcome it.\" Santos\\' caveat -- \"[if] the world thinks that\\'s the solution\" -- nods to the global reach of Latin America\\'s drug trafficking organizations, underscoring the desire for a debate that includes producers and consumers (who are concentrated in the U.S. and Europe). This distinction is important; indeed, personal consumption of drugs like marijuana and cocaine is already technically decriminalized in Mexico, Costa Rica, and Colombia, while the total number of convictions for personal drug possession in Guatemala and Argentina combined was just 161 in 2009, according to the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission. So when an ex-military general like Perez or a former defense minister like Santos talks about decriminalization, it\\'s not because they care so much about personal liberties. Rather, they have one major goal in mind: choking off the resources that fuel drug cartels and the violence they practice. As Perez explained recently in advance of a Central American conference on alternative drug strategy sponsored by his administration in Antigua, \"drugs are expensive precisely because they are prohibited...traffickers will lose if they cease to be profitable.\" While no detailed proposal is yet on the table, his idea of decriminalization is clear: create a legal framework to make the production and transport of cocaine legal, at least throughout Central America -- a region through which approximately 80 percent of the cocaine heading to the United States stops. Bringing the business of this $37 billion industry out into the open, it is assumed, would reduce the imperative of traffickers to corrupt public officials and their need to use violence against both governments and rivals for access to the best trafficking routes.'}],\n",

       "    'content': 'There’s the question: for what? Felipe Calderon was once convinced he had the answer: to crack down on the kingpins; restore moral order. But Calderon’s war had a pretty clear outcome: the bad guys won. Capos were shot, but their cartels just split and proliferated: more gang warfare, more severed heads dumped on beaches; more corpses carved up and left on busy streets for kids to gawp at; extortion, kidnap, rape. It soon became clear even to Calderon that the ‘war on drugs’ was unwinnable, for the simple reason that the cause of the mayhem is not in Mexico, it’s in the States. For as long as there are American junkies, Mexico will pay the blood price for their addiction. This has been the status quo for the past few decades, and as far as I could tell on my Mexican adventure last year, Maria was right: no one expected Peña Nieto to change much of anything. He belongs to the PRI — the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which ruled Mexico for most of the past century, and its approach to the cartels has been a blind eye. But late last year, there was a new twist: America, having spent billions on Calderon’s daft crusade, last month voted to legalise cannabis in some states (if the federal government gives them the OK). Colorado and Washington started it, California is keen to follow suit, and Oregon, Rhode Island, Maine and Vermont aren’t far behind. It creates an irony that the Mexican president is puzzling over: some 40 per cent of the cartels’ business is selling cannabis across the border, so why should Mexico bust a gut keeping it from getting to America, if it’s legal there? This new legislation, said one of Peña Nieto’s advisers cautiously, ‘changes the rules of the game’. It does, and it also creates an opportunity, though one that Peña Nieto might not welcome. If the Mexican president is brave enough, he could not just follow the new rules, but perhaps change the game. He could follow the lead of President Otto Pérez Molina of Guatemala, who has asked the question: if fighting doesn’t work, why not legalise drugs instead? Molina is a former head of the intelligence services who has himself tried the iron-fist approach to gangs, but now he says the price paid in human lives is too high. ‘It’s time to end the myths, the taboos, and discuss legalisation.’ Perhaps it sounds like a dramatic step. It’s certainly one America would oppose with every star and stripe, because to legalise drugs in Mexico would be to push the fight alarmingly close to their border. But then, even as a tourist there, you can see Mexico requires a dramatic step. To say that the police aren’t effective is an almost comic understatement. It’s not just that there are good cops and bad cops; it’s that it’s impossible to tell the difference. Take this little tangle. Last year, in June, there was a shootout in the food court of Mexico City airport, Terminal 2. Three police officers who suspected another three of drug-smuggling went (they say) to make an arrest. The drug-running cops opened fire, killed the good cops, then skipped off scot-free, leaving clumps of traumatised Texan tourists shivering under canteen tables, vowing never to leave Dallas again. It later turned out that the runaway cops were in fact the good guys. They had been about to expose all the other cops as drug-smugglers, and had been shot at as a result. All 348 airport cops were later re-shuffled to other states. If you think perhaps the answer to Mexico’s troubles is a tougher army, then I’d like to introduce you to Los Zetas. They are often also described as the paramilitary wing of the older Gulf Cartel, but that hasn’t been true for a while. In 2010 they bit off the hand that fed them, formed their own gang, and began to show their rivals the true meaning of brutality. The Zetas specialise in the butchering of children. They have been phenomenally successful, just recently overtaking the famous Sinaloa cartel and dominating the country. How have they managed this? Because they came from the army, from Mexico’s equivalent of the SAS. They were trained by American and Israeli special forces in intimidation, ambushing and marksmanship, just to fight the drug gangs. Then they upped and formed one. The Zetas still recruit from Mexico’s special forces and from the Guatemalan equivalent, the Kaibiles. The more cash America puts into training the Mexican army, the happier the Zetas are, purring over all the potential new recruits. So there aren’t really many other alternatives. Why not legalise drugs? It wouldn’t be giving up, it would be winning without fighting — the best, cleverest way. The cartels would be forced above ground; the big money would be in legitimate business. The psychos, like Rosario Reta (opposite), would no longer be required, and who knows, the police might once again become an effective force.'}],\n",

Latin American decisionmakers are now openly questioning why they should continue to sacrifice police and soldiers to enforce drug laws when legal markets for marijuana now exist in the U.S. “Everyone is asking, What sense does it make to keep up such an intense confrontation, which has cost Mexico so much, by trying to keep this substance from going to a country where it’s already regulated and permitted?” says Fernando Belaunzarán, a Congressman from Mexico’s opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party who introduced a marijuana-legalization measure in the legislature a week after the U.S. elections. The measure, Belaunzarán tells TIME, is modeled on the Washington State law and would put the federal government in charge of marijuana production, regulation and sales. The Congressman says he expects the lower house to convene public hearings on marijuana legalization by May 2013. Belaunzarán joins a growing list of Latin American leaders calling for a change in the drug-war paradigm — one that considers drug decriminalization and legalization as alternatives to the U.S.-led prohibitionist model, the enforcement of which has helped turn swathes of Latin America into the world’s most violent regions.

       "    'content': 'This week’s meeting between Presidents Obama and Peña Nieto brings U.S.-Mexico relations to center stage. This second face-to-face between the two leaders occurs at a critical time in each presidency. Domestic reform efforts that have far-reaching implications for the bilateral agenda are underway in both countries. These include immigration reform in the U.S. and reforms to boost economic competitiveness in Mexico and though they inject some short-term uncertainty into the relationship they also infuse it with a sense of new possibilities and opportunity.¶ Recent efforts to broaden the discourse on U.S.-Mexico relations have been largely successful—and overdue. Nevertheless, security remains the focal point for many citizens of both countries and a primary challenge for Mexican leaders.¶   Peña Nieto campaigned on promises of a recalibrated strategy on security and the Mexican public has been patient in granting his administration time to develop its approach. But there are risks in the pace his team seems to have adopted, including mounting skepticism —at home and to some extent in the U.S.— that the issue has not been given the priority it deserves. Mexican officials emphasize their commitment is strong and encompasses efforts to reduce violence, protect human rights and construct a rule of law that supports a more open and competitive economy.¶   Now near the 150-day mark of his six-year term, Peña Nieto has pushed through a number of long-awaited reforms —to labor, education and telecommunications— and is readying other, thornier ones for action. His efforts have been widely praised and his popularity is high, but passing the reforms is just the opening act. Implementation is crucial. And it’s this recognition that has prompted many observers, particularly Mexicans themselves, to be more circumspect in their praise of the administration’s accomplishments to date.¶ The foundation for the administration’s ambitious reform drive has been the Pact for Mexico, an historic agreement Peña Nieto and the leaders of the two main opposition parties signed the day after the new PRI president took office. A few days ago the administration was forced to temporarily suspend all activities related to the Pact, including a planned announcement of financial reforms.¶ The crisis was provoked by the opposition’s discovery that the PRI was using public funds to finance party-run programs —and thereby gain political advantage— ahead of local elections in July. The dispute has exposed the inherent political tensions and consequent limitations of the Pact.¶ Though the parties may be able to resolve the immediate controversy, many see signs that the alliance is fraying and expect negotiations for remaining initiatives on the 95-item reform agenda—including highly anticipated fiscal and energy reform packages—to be more problematic.¶ President Obama will be able to sympathize with his Mexican counterpart on this score. Over four years and 100-days into his second term he has become well acquainted with difficult negotiations. Like other two-term presidents, he may soon look to foreign affairs to burnish his legacy. His visit to Mexico offers a rare opportunity to promote goals in both the domestic and foreign policy arenas.¶ President Obama will emphasize the need to continue to effect close security cooperation and coordination. He will also seek to positively frame the immigration reform debate, which is just getting underway in the U.S. Senate and is expected to continue for the remainder of the year. The visit to Mexico affords the chance to highlight the successful and interconnected economic partnership the countries share and to make the case for immigration reform as essential to North America’s economic security. And in many respects President Peña Nieto will have the opportunity to do the same.¶ The U.S.-Mexico economic partnership is thriving. Mexico is the U.S.’s second largest export market and third leading source of imports. Bilateral trade reached nearly one-half trillion dollars in 2012, roughly $1.4 billion each day. An estimated six million U.S. jobs depend on trade with Mexico. And strong regional supply chains mean that nearly 40 percent of every product the U.S. imports from Mexico is really “Made in America.” ¶ As strong as the bilateral relationship is now, however, it must deepen and evolve in order to ensure expanded opportunity and security for both countries going forward. Presidents Peña Nieto and Obama have both entered a post-honeymoon environment that demands hard work and successively heavier lifts on every policy goal.¶   With the stakes potentially so high on so many issues fundamental to the relationship, only the highest-level commitment will advance the agenda. There may never be a more opportune time.'}],\n",

       "    'content': 'The U.S. and Mexico are as tightly bound as siblings, and often just as dysfunctional. While both governments are concerned with immigration and drug violence, President Obama must forge a more positive, productive partnership. Mexico is enjoying remarkable economic growth, and Obama neglects our southern neighbor at his own peril.¶ Obama will arrive in Mexico with good and bad news. On the positive side, he can highlight the progress his administration has made towards overhauling our immigration system. The border is more secure than ever, and the Senate has unveiled a proposal that creates new pathways for legal immigration. On the negative side, Obama bears responsibility for his failure to reform U.S. gun laws. ThinkProgress reports that the expiration of the assault weapons ban has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Mexicans in cartel violence. Even worse, America’s demand for illegal drugs fuels the growth of these cartels. ¶ However, Obama would be wise to recognize that relations with Mexico should not center on these issues alone. As president-elect, Peña Nieto wrote in The Washington Post that, “It is a mistake to limit our bilateral relationship to drugs and security concerns. Our mutual interests are too vast and complex to be restricted in this short-sighted way.” He wants a deeper relationship, one that is defined by shared economic goals.¶  That’s the smart way forward. Since 2008, Mexico has seen steady economic growth, which has been a net benefit to the U.S. The U.S. exports more to Mexico than to China and Japan combined, and U.S./Mexico trade hit almost $500 billion in 2012. Obama should build on these ties to create greater economic integration. If he and Peña Nieto were to collaborate on ways of matching Mexico’s young labor force with American technology and training, it would be a recipe for a regional economic boom. Greater U.S. investment in Mexico will make the country safer, as the cartels generally leave multinational operations alone.¶  Politically, Obama cannot afford to take Mexico for granted. Consider that Mexico has been fully engaged with Cuba since the revolution in 1959 (which was launched from Mexico). And although the U.S. has not recognized Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro as successor to Hugo Chavez, Mexico recognized his election on April 19. So Mexico is not an ally that automatically falls in lockstep with American interests. Perhaps with more attention from the Obama administration, Peña Nieto could be persuaded to be more supportive of U.S. policies for the region.¶   True, there are legitimate reasons why Mexico has been viewed warily by past administrations. Mexico has historically been the largest source of our undocumented population. Border towns have long feared spillover violence from the drug cartels. But illegal immigration is at net zero, and the fears of violence on the U.S. side of the border have proved largely unfounded. Obama should take the lead in encouraging more communication and cooperation with Mexico. Already, Peña Nieto favors opening Mexico’s energy sector to private investment, and he may even allow foreign investment in its state oil company.¶ President Obama has the chance to turn a page in U.S./Mexico relations, and he should not miss it. It’s time for a foreign policy with Mexico based on its potential, not on its problems.'}],\n",

That should start with an unwavering commitment to the attributes that have made this country exceptional and great, and an equally clear rejection of what the various transnationalists and other U.S. foes seek to do to her.¶ Unfortunately, President Obama has nominated as the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations someone whose record indicates she is unsuited for the job in both regards. In fact, Samantha Power has for decades found fault with America and its historical role in the world. For example, in 2003, she wrote in the New Republic:¶ We need: a historical reckoning with crimes committed, sponsored, or permitted by the United States….Instituting a doctrine of the mea culpa would enhance our credibility by showing that American decision-makers do not endorse the sins of their predecessors. When Willie Brandt went down on one knee in the Warsaw ghetto, his gesture was gratifying to World War II survivors, but it was also ennobling and cathartic for Germany…¶ In the same essay, Power declared that: “Much anti-Americanism derives from the role U.S. political, economic and military power has played in denying such freedoms to others.” It is one thing to hear this sort of anti-American propaganda from foreigners who choose to ignore our country’s unsurpassed history of expending vast quantities of lives and national treasure to help secure others’ freedoms. It would be totally unacceptable in our representative at the UN.¶ Power also seems to dismiss blithely the huge contribution made by the United States in response to many international tragedies, at which the first ones on the scene are often our military personnel, providing assistance and asking nothing in return. Such sentiments should be considered absolute disqualifiers for the position of one of our nation’s most visible diplomats.¶ Power has also been an advocate for various initiatives aimed at restricting U.S. freedom of action. This includes notably subordinating the use of its military and foreign assistance to UN mandates and circumstances in which we have no national interest. For instance, as recently as 2008, she opined: “Influence is best measured not only by military hardware and GDP, but also by other people's perceptions that we, the United States, are using our power legitimately…that we are acting in the interests of the global commons and in accordance with the rule of law….”¶ This is, of course, a formula for allowing the United Nations or “other people’s perceptions” to define the legitimacy of U.S. actions. And when there may be a conflict between the “interests of the global commons” (UN-speak for the international community and the parts of the globe over which it asserts authority, e.g., the oceans, the air and even near-earth space), clearly in her view, America must defer and submit. As she has put it:¶ The United States must cease its reliance on gratuitous unilateralism. We make rules and create international institutions precisely in order to bind states when their short-term interests would otherwise lead them toward defection…¶ It is no exaggeration to observe that Samantha Power would make a perfect representative of the United Nations to the United States, but not the other way around.¶ Entrusting the job of standing up for America at the UN to someone so ill-, or at ill-equipped, or at least so ill-disposed for that task will be tantamount to unilaterally disarming in not just the war of ideas. It will embolden our adversaries to redouble their efforts to use the United Nations as a vehicle for hamstringing this country, like the fictional Lilliputians did with Gulliver.¶ The last thing we can afford at a moment when the world needs strong and effective leadership from the United States, both in the UN and elsewhere, is to entrust the duty of providing it at Turtle Bay to someone who has spent her professional career deriding this country, defaming it and seeking to circumscribe its power wherever possible. ¶ We urge the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to explore Samantha Power’s problematic record with care during its hearing on her nomination on July 17th and, having done so, to ensure that such a person is not confirmed as our representative to the United Nations.\"}],\n",

       "    'content': 'Closing the yield gap and Indirect links and ‘Leakage’ occur whereby deforestation is not reduced,¶ But simply displaced¶ Once the soy moratorium was put in place, many researchers illustrated its positive influence of¶ reducing Amazonian deforestation(Rudorff et al., 2011), even alongside increasing soy production.¶ Others, however, point out several reasons to be cautious about this impact over the short and long¶ term. First, The Union of Concerned Scientists points out that at least part of the continued growth¶ in soy production after the moratorium was due to increased productivity rather than expansion¶ (Boucher, 2011). Brazilian and Paraguayan yields per hectare were improved to levels comparable¶ to the US – where the highest productivity levels are found (Table 3). As this ‘yield gap’ is closed,¶ “the potential gain from ‘catching up’ is reduced” (Boucher, 2011:8; Licker et al., 2010), suggesting¶ That the benefits of intensification are likely to have a time limited effect.¶ Calculations the author is using are of soy cropland and production data (MAG, 2010).¶ Secondly, many authors raised alarm bells that the continued growth of the soy industry combined¶ with decreasing deforestation, implied leakage of deforestation to other regions and ecosystems or¶ via other sectors. Leakage may occur into countries or regions with more relaxed environmental¶ legislation and enforcement, or to ecosystems not protected by existing enforcement. For example,¶ the displacement of soy expansion from tropical forests to savannahs has been highlighted(Merry¶ Baker & Small, 2005).¶ Finally, there are concerns that as the direct causal relationship between soy production and¶ deforestation declines in importance, the indirect influences bear greater attention. Other sectors¶ or industries, for example, can mediate effects of leakage. Cattle production, for instance, has been¶ assigned much of the blame for deforestation rates that were once reserved for soy. This however, neglects the expansion of soy onto former pasture, pushing cattle production – not subject to the¶ soy moratorium –into newly deforested regions(Barona et al., 2010). Soy production is distanced¶ from deforestation, but is still part of the broad causal relationship.'}],\n",

The results from the three models – ordinary least squares (OLS), fixed-effects without time lag for soy (FE1), and fixed effects with time lag for soy (FE2) – are shown in the figure. \"We introduced a time-lag into one of the models as land-use change is not an immediate effect,\" explained Arima.'}],\n",

       "    'content': 'Legalization  FOR a growing number of American policy makers, politicians and activists, the best answer to the spiraling violence in Mexico is to legalize the marijuana that, they argue, fuels the country’s vicious cartels and smugglers. After all, according to official estimates, marijuana constitutes 60 percent of cartels’ drug profits. Legalization would move that trade into the open market, driving down the price and undermining the cartels’ power and influence. Unfortunately, it’s not that easy. Marijuana legalization has many merits, but it would do little to hinder the long-term economics of the cartels — and the violent toll they take on Mexican society. For one thing, if marijuana makes up 60 percent of the cartels’ profits, that still leaves another 40 percent, which includes the sale of methamphetamine, cocaine, and brown-powder and black-tar heroin. If marijuana were legalized, the cartels would still make huge profits from the sale of these other drugs. Plus, there’s no reason the cartels couldn’t enter the legal market for the sale of marijuana, as organized crime groups did in the United States after the repeal of Prohibition. Still, legalization would deliver a significant short-term hit to the cartels — if drug trafficking were the only activity they were engaged in. But cartels derive a growing slice of their income from other illegal activities. Some experts on organized crime in Latin America, like Edgardo Buscaglia, say that cartels earn just half their income from drugs. Indeed, in recent years cartels have used an extensive portfolio of rackets and scams to diversify their income. For example, they used to kidnap rivals, informants and incompetent subordinates to punish, exact revenge or send a message. Now that they have seen that people are willing to pay heavy ransoms, kidnapping has become their second-most-lucrative venture, with the targets ranging from businessmen to migrants. Another new source of cartel revenue is oil theft, long a problem for the Mexican government. The national oil company, Pemex, loses hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of petroleum every year to bandits and criminal gangs who tap into pipelines and siphon it off. Now the cartels are getting involved in this business, working with associates north of the border to sell the oil to American companies at huge markups. In 2009 a federal court convicted an American businessman of helping to funnel $2 million in petroleum products stolen from Pemex by a Mexican cartel, eventually selling it to a Texas chemical plant owned by the German chemical company BASF. The chemical company claims never to have known where the products came from. Cartels are also moving into the market in pirated goods in Latin America. The market used to be dominated by terrorist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas, who operated in the triborder area of Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay. Now the field is being overtaken by Mexican cartels, which already have so much control over the sale of pirated CDs, DVDs and software that many legitimate companies no longer even bother to distribute their full-price products in parts of Mexico. Taking another page from traditional organized crime, cartels are also moving into extortion. A cartel representative will approach the owner of a business — whether a pharmacy or a taco stand — demanding a monthly stipend for “protection.” If those payments aren’t made on time, the business is often burned to the ground, or the owner is threatened, kidnapped or killed. A popular cartel racket involves branded products. For example, a cartel member — most often from Los Zetas and La Familia Michoacana, two of the largest and most diversified cartels — will tell a music-store owner that he has to sell CDs with the Zetas logo stamped on them, with the cartel taking a 25 percent cut of the profits. Noncompliance isn’t an option. With so many lines of business, it’s unlikely that Mexican cartels would close up shop in the event of legalization, even if it meant a serious drop in profits from their most successful product. Cartels are economic entities, and like any legitimate company the best are able to adapt in the face of a changing market. This is not to say that drug legalization shouldn’t be considered for other reasons. We need to stop viewing casual users as criminals, and we need to treat addicts as people with health and emotional problems. Doing so would free up a significant amount of jail space, court time and law enforcement resources. What it won’t do, though, is stop the violence in Mexico.'}],\n",

Crime rates are usually the result of economic disparities, lower educational levels, high unemployment rates and weak and corrupt law enforcement agencies.

As an example, Mexico’s infamous Zetas organization is rarely involved in drug trafficking. Its main businesses include oil theft, human trafficking, kidnappings, extortion and brothels. And finally, if drugs are legalized in the Americas but remain illegal in the U.S., criminal organizations from Latin America will keep fighting between each other to reach the profitable American market.'}],\n",

       "    'content': 'Los Zetas, a Mexican drug cartel, provides an interesting case study in illustrating this point. The Mexican DTO decided to venture into migrant smuggling in an effort to increase its profits. Today such smuggling is Los Zetas’ second most lucrative activity; its influence has spread all the way to Petén in northern Guatemala. According to the Guatemalan Human Rights Commission, human smuggling was not a part of organized criminal networks before Los Zetas began targeting the industry. Instead, “coyotes,” independent human smugglers, would charge fees to smuggle groups of migrants through Mexico and into the United States. Because of their substantial drug profits, Los Zetas completely transformed the human smuggling industry. While coyotes could only smuggle scarcely more than twenty migrants at a time, Los Zetas could smuggle hundreds of migrants in armored vehicles across the border. Ultimately, Los Zetas gained control of the Guatemalan human smuggling market, killing anyone attempting to travel beyond their control.10 The estimated industry value of migrant smuggling in Latin America today is $6.6 billion USD according to the U.N. report on crime globalization, having grown in no small part from Los Zetas.11 Morris Panner, a former U.S. federal crime prosecutor, suggests that the trend of DTOs exploring new “business” ventures is far more pervasive than their drug trade involvement. He goes on to imply that the entire business model for Latin American organized crime is in a transitional period, in which these organizations are diversifying ways to earn money, either as a growth or survival strategy.12 For example, PEMEX, the Mexican state-owned oil company, has reported that the local committee has lost approximately 40 percent of its production, or $750 million USD, to oil theft in cartel-controlled territory.13 While other figures are difficult to estimate, kidnap ransoming is valued between $200 million and $500 million USD annually.14 It appears that these industries are growing as a result of continuing U.S. drug demand and DTO incubation. While Panner does not adequately address the potential impact of widespread drug legalization, he does conclude that criminal organizations are “pursuing a larger, more extensive agenda.”15 It appears DTOs are able to expand into other illicit markets because of their substantial drug trade revenues.'}],\n",
